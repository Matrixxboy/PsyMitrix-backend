We also need charts_data: two comparison tables, one radar chart dataset, one bar chart dataset. Provide arrays of data? Likely structure: comparison_tables: [ {title:..., headers:..., rows:...}, {...} ]. Radar chart dataset: maybe {labels: [...], values: [...]}. Bar chart dataset: similar.\n\nWe must avoid referencing theories etc. but we can allude subtle insights. But output must be JSON only.\n\nLet's craft sections as array of objects maybe {title: \"...\", content: \"...\"}.\n\nMake sure total word count ~400. Let's aim 380 words across all content strings.\n\nNeed to compute word count quickly? Let's approximate.\n\nWe need to incorporate details: Name Utsav, male, DOB 2004-07-14. Age ~21. Blood group B+. Sibling context: older sibling 1, none younger.\n\nWe'll produce sections accordingly.\n\nLet's draft.\n\nSection 1 Openness: mention curiosity, creativity, open to new experiences, likely high due to age.\n\nSection 2 Individualization: self-directed, goal-oriented, independent.\n\nSection 3 Introversion-Extraversion: social style; perhaps moderate extraversion.\n\nSection 4 Self-Esteem: core self-worth high due to achievements.\n\nSection 5 Enneagram & DISC: Provide synthesized personality summary: maybe Enneagram type 3 (Achiever) and DISC: C (Conscientious). Combine.\n\nSection 6 FIRO-B Summary: interpersonal needs: Inclusion high, Control moderate, Affection moderate.\n\nSection 7 Career Fit: suitable paths: project management, entrepreneurship, creative industries, consulting.\n\nSection 8 Neuro Map: link each trait to brain region: Openness prefrontal cortex; Individualization dorsal anterior cingulate; Introversion Extraversion amygdala; Self-Esteem nucleus accumbens; Enneagram DISC: etc; FIRO-B: etc; Career Fit: etc; Neuro Map: maybe list.\n\nNow charts_data: Two comparison tables: maybe Age vs Peers, Blood group distribution; Or Openness vs Extraversion. Provide simple arrays.\n\nRadar chart dataset: labels: [\"Openness\", \"Individualization\", \"Intro/Extro\", \"Self-Esteem\", \"Enneagram\", \"DISC\", \"FIRO-B\"]; values: numbers.\n\nBar chart dataset: maybe \"Strength\" vs \"Area\" categories.\n\nWe must output JSON object with keys 'sections' and 'charts_data'.\n\nLet's craft sections array objects with title and content.\n\nEnsure no markdown, just JSON.\n\nLet's produce."
